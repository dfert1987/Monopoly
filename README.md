# Laowai Monopoly

![landing page](./src/Assets/ReadMePics/landing.png)

## Description

This project is a two-player Monopoly game built in React.

Having lived as an expat in Beijing for almost 6 years, I still miss my time in China everyday. My fond memories of being young, dumb and living in China for some reason inspired me to build this game. Initially I just was playing around with how to make a board game as a front-end excersise, then gradually became more and more invested in the project. Currently, the game is pretty flushed out and plays just about like a normal game of Monopoly would.

Unfortunately, since I didn't initially plan on coming close to finishing this project, I never built out a backend. So you can only play people that you're actually sitting next to on the same computer. You also can't refresh the screen... I mean honestly, you're probably not going to finish a whole game anyway.

![bpiecesoard](./src/Assets/ReadMePics/choose-piece.png)
Once you're in the game you click Play to enter on the landing screen.

Then choose your pieces on the next screen (you have quite a few Beijing inspired options)

After this you can view the main board.

## Demo

Check out a quick video demo here!

## Features

Your controls are on the bottom of the screen. Here you can:

- See how much money you have.
- Roll the dice (you roll twice in a row on doubles)
- View all of the assets that you and your opponents own.
  - Clicking this will allow you build houses/hotels as well.
- Use your visa (get out of jail free card) if you have one.
- Mortgage and Buy Back Properties.
- After rolling you will be prompted by modals based on where you landed.
- If properties are unowned you may buy them, if owned by the other player you'll have to pay rent.
- Just like regular monopoly players can 'Go to Jail (get deoported)', 'Pass GO and collect 200', pay various taxes and fees, win a pot from a "Free Parking" equivelant, as well as draw Chance/Community Chest type cards with other instructions.
- If you dont have enough money to pay a specific fee/rent, you'll be prompted with a modal asking if you wish to mortgage properties to continue playing, or just concede. (This is a work in progress!)
